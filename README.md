# Predicting-individuals-average-credit-card-debt

## Introduction
Given a dataset containing information regarding credit card owners, the goal is to predict their average amount of debt using Multivariate regression models.  To do so, we are given several features describing a credit card owner's profile such as demographics variables (his education level, age, gender, ethnicity..) or financial information (his credit limit, credit rating, number of credit cards..)

This jupyter notebook introduces a master template of data scientist workflow when it comes to using a multivariate linear regression.
